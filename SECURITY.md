# Reporting Security Issues

jonzeolla and the triss25 community take security
seriously, and appreciate all efforts that disclose concerns responsibly.

If you believe you've found a security bug in our project, please contact us at
[security@jonzeolla.com](mailto:security@jonzeolla.com) and include the words
"triss25 vulnerability" in the subject line. If you believe
you've found a security bug in a third-party project used by triss25,
please report it to those those maintainers.

Your email will be acknowledged within one business day, and you'll receive a
more detailed response to your email as soon as possible indicating the next
steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and
announcement.
